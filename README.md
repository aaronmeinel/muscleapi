# A simple workout tracker

## MVP
- Log a set
- Create a plan
- See your plans
- See todays workout and your progress (which implicitly tells you what sets are left to do)
- Simple progression -> if last target was met, increase reps or weight by about 2.5%, if target was drastically exceeded (>2 reps +), 5%

## Roadmap
- Predictive analytics (more elaborate progression prediction)
- Adjust plan on the go (differentiate between template and plan?)
